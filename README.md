# Current Stage of Development
Frens is currently in the Pre-alpha stage of development. This means we are in the conceptual phase, and actively brainstorming, researching, and deciding the key features and capabilities our platform should have. While we've made progress and built some parts of the platform, there's still a lot more to explore and develop.

Here's a breakdown of the different stages of development:

Pre-alpha: This is the current phase we're in. The focus of this phase is to brainstorm, conceptualize and define the key features and functionalities our platform will offer. We are in the process of drafting, designing and prototyping several features and experimenting with different ideas.

Alpha: In the next stage, we'll have a clear roadmap of the features we want to implement, and we'll be actively working on bringing them to life. Some parts of the platform will become functional, but it's important to note that heavy development will still be underway.

Beta: Once all planned features are implemented, we'll move on to the beta phase. This is when extensive testing, debugging, and refinement occur. All features will be in place, but there may be bugs and reliability issues that need to be ironed out.

Release: This is our end goal - a fully functional, reliable, and user-friendly platform that's free from bugs. In the release stage, Frens will be ready for everyday use, offering a robust set of features and a smooth user experience.

We are excited about the journey ahead and we are committed to making Frens a top-notch social platform. If you're interested in following our progress, contributing, or just learning more, please keep an eye on our GitHub repo and join our community!
