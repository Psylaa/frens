# The Purpose

Frens was born out of a necessity to address prevalent issues in current ActivityPub implementations. Our mission is to redefine the standards and deliver an optimized user experience.

## User Experience and Interface

A server oriented towards end-users requires an intuitive and appealing frontend. With the ambition to establish more than just a standard, we're developing our own frontend, [Frens Frontend Material](https://github.com/bwoff11/frens-frontend-material). Our goal is to inspire others to create frontends, but only after we've established that it's feasible to develop an easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing frontend. We've adopted the JSON API standard to provide developers with a consistent and reliable interface, protecting them from ever-evolving and inconsistent standards.

## Performance and Sustainability

We've observed existing implementations to be either performance-limited or too arcane for widespread contributions. Our choice of the Go programming language aims to resolve these issues. Go offers satisfactory performance and, more importantly, a codebase that is comprehensible and accessible for contributions. Furthermore, we've opted for a SQL database over a graph database. Despite the suitability of graph databases for social networks, their complexity and maintenance requirements outweigh their benefits. A SQL database, on the other hand, is easier to maintain and is more familiar to a wider audience.

## Embracing Modern Technologies

In our pursuit of delivering an exemplary user experience, we've chosen to incorporate a variety of contemporary technologies. These include features such as algorithmic feeds and subscription services. We believe that when deployed thoughtfully, these technologies can substantially enhance user engagement and interaction. While we are still evaluating the suite of features we will provide, we do not shy away from integrating technologies that mutually benefit users and server operators. At Frens, our mission is to harmoniously blend technology with user expectations, creating a platform that embodies the future of social networking.

## Adherence to Professional Standards

Regrettably, certain project communities fail to meet the professional standards we believe to be essential. At Frens, we aim to be a beacon of professionalism, inclusivity, and excellence. We strive to foster a project that others can admire and learn from. To ensure this, we've drafted a Code of Conduct that respects the identities and affiliations of *all* individuals. We are committed to implementing workflows and standards that inspire confidence in the reliability and security of our platform.
