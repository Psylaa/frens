# Frens
Welcome to Frens, a decentralized social networking platform engineered for performance, scalability, and respect for user privacy. Our platform is lightweight yet robust, built on Go, and is dedicated to providing an enhanced social media experience that prioritizes user control over data.

## Key Features
One of the biggest blockers to the widespread adoption of decentralized social media is esoteric API standards. Therefore, we have chosen to stricly adhere to the JSON API specification, which is widely used and well-documented. This allows developers to easily integrate Frens into their existing applications, and makes it easy for users to migrate their data to Frens.

Additionally, the API is fully documented with swagger, which allows for easy integration into any application.

## Comprehensive Documentation in Our Wiki
Our extensive wiki is your primary resource for all things Frens. Whether you're a user looking to get the most out of the Frens platform, a developer eager to dive into our code, or a curious onlooker who wants to understand our design philosophy and AI integration strategy, the wiki has you covered.

Our wiki is meticulously organized and updated, providing a wealth of knowledge about every aspect of Frens. It serves as a roadmap, guiding you through our:

Design Philosophy: Understand the principles that drive our development process and learn about our AI integration.
API Documentation: Dive into the details of our intuitive API, with clear explanations and examples to ease your development process.
Development Stages: Get a clear idea about our development strategy, from pre-alpha to release stages.
And much more!
Our commitment to transparency and education means our wiki is always growing and evolving, just like Frens itself. It's not just a manualâ€”it's a journey into the heart of our project.
